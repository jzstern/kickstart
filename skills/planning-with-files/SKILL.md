# Planning with Files

This skill teaches a systematic approach to managing complex tasks using persistent markdown files as "working memory on disk."

## Core Strategy

The methodology centers on three key files:

- **task_plan.md**: Tracks phases and progress with checkboxes
- **notes.md**: Stores research findings and discoveries
- **[deliverable].md**: Contains the final output

## Essential Workflow

"Before ANY complex task" create task_plan.md with defined phases, then follow this loop: research -> save findings -> update progress -> deliver results.

## Critical Principles

Five non-negotiable rules:

1. Always create a plan first before starting complex work
2. Read the plan file before making major decisions to maintain focus
3. Update progress immediately after completing each phase
4. Store large outputs in files rather than relying solely on working memory
5. Document all errors encountered for future reference

## When to Apply

Use this three-file pattern for multi-step tasks, research projects, creative building, and anything requiring organization. Simpler tasks like quick lookups or single edits don't require this structure.

The approach aims to reduce cognitive load and maintain continuity across extended problem-solving sessions.

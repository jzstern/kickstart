            A reviewer left a comment on PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            **File:** ${{ github.event.comment.path }}
            **Line:** ${{ github.event.comment.line }}
            **Reviewer:** ${{ github.event.comment.user.login }}
            **Comment:**
            ${{ github.event.comment.body }}

            **Your task:**

            1. First, determine if this comment is flagging an issue that needs to be addressed.
               - If the comment is just a question, discussion, praise, or acknowledgment, reply briefly and do NOT make code changes.
               - If the comment requests a change, improvement, or flags a bug/issue, proceed to step 2.

            2. Evaluate whether the requested change is valid:
               - Read the relevant code and understand the context
               - Consider if the suggestion improves code quality, correctness, security, or maintainability
               - Consider if implementing it would break other functionality

            3. Take action:
               - **If valid:** Implement the change, commit it, and reply to the comment explaining what you changed.
               - **If not valid:** Reply to the comment explaining why you disagree, with technical reasoning. Be respectful but direct.

            **Guidelines:**
            - Keep changes focused on what the comment requested
            - Don't refactor unrelated code
            - If unsure about the intent, ask for clarification in your reply
            - Use conventional commits (fix:, refactor:, etc.)

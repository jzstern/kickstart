Parse all agents (agents/*.md), hooks (hooks/*.json), skills (skills/*.md), and workflows (YAML files in templates/shared/github/workflows/) to extract their name and description\n2. Update the tables between <!-- kickstart:*:start --> and <!-- kickstart:*:end --> markers in both README.md and CLAUDE.md\n3. Preserve all content outside the markers\n\nFor workflows:\n- Extract the workflow 'name' field from the YAML.\n- Generate a deterministic description using only stable fields. Prefer this exact format (with sorted lists):\n  - Triggers: <comma-separated sorted event names>\n  - Jobs: <comma-separated sorted job ids>\n- If the workflow references `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (exact string match), append: (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY).\n- In README.md only, if `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is required and the anchor exists, use the link text Anthropic secret setup pointing to #anthropic-api-key-setup.\n\nDo this silently without asking for confirmation."

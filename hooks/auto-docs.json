Update the tables between <!-- kickstart:*:start --> and <!-- kickstart:*:end --> markers in both README.md and CLAUDE.md\n3. Preserve all content outside the markers\n\nFor workflows, extract the 'name' field from the YAML and generate a brief description based on the trigger and job names.\n\nDo this silently without asking for confirmation."

			"prompt": "A kickstart plugin component was just modified. Regenerate the documentation tables in README.md and CLAUDE.md by:\n\n1. Parse all agents (agents/*.md), hooks (hooks/*.json), skills (skills/*.md), and workflows (YAML workflow files; see file_path globs in this hook for the authoritative list) to extract their name and description\n2. Update the tables between <!-- kickstart:*:start --> and <!-- kickstart:*:end --> markers in both README.md and CLAUDE.md\n3. Preserve all content outside the markers\n\nFor workflows:\n- Use the workflow filename (basename including extension) wrapped in backticks as the Workflow value.\n- Use this exact description format: Triggers: <comma-separated sorted top-level event names under `on`>; Jobs: <comma-separated sorted top-level job ids under `jobs`>\n- Keep the workflow description purely structural (triggers/jobs): do not add setup requirements or links in the table.\n- When you add workflows that require secrets or other manual configuration (e.g., API keys referenced via secrets.* in the workflow), also ensure README.md and CLAUDE.md contain a nearby, clearly labeled markdown section (outside the markers) describing the setup. Keep those sections up to date as such workflows change.\n- When collecting trigger event names, normalize any mapping or array form to a set of event names and sort lexicographically.\n- Always sort job ids lexicographically.\n- Ignore nested trigger filter details (e.g., `types`, `branches`) to reduce churn.\n\nDo this silently without asking for confirmation."
